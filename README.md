PYTHON MINI PROJECT:
SMART EXPENSE TRACKING APP
The SmartExpense App is a Python-based project designed to assist users in managing their personal finances in a structured and efficient manner. The app provides several key features, including tracking daily expenses, setting budgets for various categories (such as food, transport, and entertainment), and managing recurring payments like rent or subscriptions. It simplifies the otherwise complex task of financial management by offering a user-friendly interface and practical tools.

One of the standout features of the app is its ability to check spending against budgets, alerting users when they exceed their limits. Additionally, it organizes expenses into categories and generates insightful reports. These reports include a detailed breakdown of spending and visualizations, such as pie charts, to help users understand their financial habits better.

The app uses Python libraries such as datetime for managing dates and schedules, collections.defaultdict for budget tracking, and matplotlib for data visualization. By combining these technologies, the app ensures accurate record-keeping and meaningful insights for the user.
